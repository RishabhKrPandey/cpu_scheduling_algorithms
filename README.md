# 🖥️ CPU Scheduling Visualizer

A **web-based CPU Scheduling Visualizer** built using **HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and Chart.js** to help understand various CPU scheduling algorithms.

## 🎯 Features
- ✅ Supports multiple CPU scheduling algorithms:
  - **First Come First Serve (FCFS)**
  - **Shortest Job First (SJF - Non-Preemptive & Preemptive)**
  - **Priority Scheduling (Non-Preemptive & Preemptive)**
  - **Round Robin (RR)**
- ✅ Interactive **process input table**
- ✅ **Dynamic Gantt Chart Visualization** using `Chart.js`
- ✅ Calculates:
  - **Completion Time (CT)**
  - **Turnaround Time (TAT)**
  - **Waiting Time (WT)**
  - **Average Waiting Time**
- ✅ **Add & Remove Processes Dynamically**
- ✅ **Responsive UI**

---
## 📌 How It Works
Select the Scheduling Algorithm from the dropdown.
Add processes with Arrival Time (AT), Burst Time (BT), and Priority (if required).
Click "Compute Scheduling" to:
Calculate Completion Time (CT), Turnaround Time (TAT), and Waiting Time (WT).
Generate a Gantt Chart for visualization.
Modify processes dynamically using "Add Process" and "Remove Process."
